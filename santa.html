     <p> I have had Santa for 6 years! He is a barn favorite because of his great manners. </p>

       <p> Santa and I have gone to competitions in 4 states. Unfortunately, he got hurt which caused him to
         retire early. Santa now lives in Kentucky, and is enjoying retirement there. I visit him in the summer.
         Santa is from Europe. I got him in December just before Christmas. </p>

       <h2> A bit about Santa. </h2>

       <p> Santa is a 17 year old European Warmblood gelding. He has a beautiful grey coat.
         We used to compete in the jumper and equitation ring together. Santa loves carrots.
         It's his favorite treat! I make sure to bring him bunches of those when I visit. </p>
