       <p> Santa and I have gone to competitions in 4 states. Unfortunately, he got hurt which caused him to
         retire early. Santa now lives in Kentucky, and is enjoying retirement there. I visit him in the summer.
         Santa is from Europe. I got him in December just before Christmas. </p>
