     <p> I have had Siggy for 8 years! His sweet personality also made him a barn favorite. </p>

       <p> Siggy and I have gone to competitions in 8 states. He also got to go to college with me.
         Siggy now lives in Kentucky, and is enjoying retirement there. I visit him in the summer.
         I have had him for 8 years. He also came over to the states from Europe before I got him. </p>

       <h2> A bit about Siggy. </h2>

       <p> Siggy is an 18 year old European Warmblood gelding. He has a beautiful dark bay coat.
         We used to compete in the hunter arena in all kinds of events like Junior Hunters and
         National Hunter Derbies. Siggy's favorite treat is a peppermint candy! He gets lots of
         those when I visit. </p>
