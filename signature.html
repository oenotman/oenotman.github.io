       <p> Siggy and I have gone to competitions in 8 states. He also got to go to college with me.
         Siggy now lives in Kentucky, and is enjoying retirement there. I visit him in the summer.
         I have had him for 8 years. He also came over to the states from Europe before I got him. </p>
