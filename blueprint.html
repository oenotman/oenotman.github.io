     <p> I have had Blue for 6 years! He is the flying Bluebird because jumping feels like flying with him. </p>

       <p> Blue and I have gone to competitions in 4 states. He also got to go to college with me.
         Blue now lives in Fort Lauderdale, and we go to horse shows in Wellington during the winter.
         Blue came to the USA from the Netherlands. I got him 6 weeks after he arrived. We share
         the same birthday. We are 10 years apart. </p>
